Example:

```
## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

When a change has user-facing documentation, include a canonical tasknotes.dev link:

```
## Added

- Added materialized occurrence notes for recurring tasks. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes) for setup and calendar behavior.
```

-->

## Fixed

- Fixed inline task link widgets freezing Obsidian on iPhone when entering Live Preview on a note that contains TaskNote links.
  - The widget wrapper is now marked non-editable and opts out of iOS Safari's text-selection and editability walks, so mounting inline widgets no longer stalls the input pipeline in Live Preview.
  - Thanks to @matthagger for reporting.
